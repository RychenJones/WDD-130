    <h2>Jr Dev Report</h2>
    <p>
        Communication with one of my lead devs was smooth and efficient, communication with the other was completely non-existent.
        <br><br>
        I knew fairly well what was expected for each site. Any issues were mostly with the client not the lead dev.
        <br><br>
        I was able to build out and style my pages to the best of my ability with the information provided.
        <br><br>
        I did not run into any issues with GitHub once I understood how to use it.
