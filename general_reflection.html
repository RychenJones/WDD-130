    <h2>General Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        The most challenging part of the project for me was just working with other people and figuring out what they want and how they want it. I was able to overcome it for the most part.
        <br><br>
        I really enjoyed building the site itself, especially once I began to better understand the CSS, especially the justify and align properties.
        <br><br>
        If I were to do this again, I don’t think I would do too much differently except maybe establish good contact with everyone I need to sooner.
        <br><br>
        I think I do feel a little bit more confident in working on real-world projects. I still don’t have the skills to make more complicated sites, but I could easily make a simple landing page according to a clients desires.
