    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p>
        I decided on content for a site plan by basing it off an imaginary landscaping business. I then just thought of what would be practical to advertise services. 
        <br><br>
        I communicated with my developer through text and face to face contact in class. There weren’t any issues with communication once I actually get into contact.
        <br><br>
        The work on my site looks good for HTML but it has not been properly styled yet.
        <br><br>
        I’d definitely do a little bit better on my siteplan. I realized I was missing some info and it wasn’t organized as well as it could have been.
